# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Project Overview
<p align="justify">
This project is dedicated to developing a robust credit card fraud detection system. Credit card fraud poses a significant financial threat, and this project's goal is to leverage machine learning techniques to identify fraudulent transactions. The dataset under consideration consists of credit card transactions, with a strong emphasis on detecting fraudulent activities. The dataset includes transaction details like amount, time, and anonymized numerical features.</p>

## Code Explanation

The project is structured into two core parts:
</p>

### Part 1 - Data Preprocessing and Model Training:
<p align="justify">
The initial phase involves extensive data preprocessing. This encompasses data analysis, handling class imbalance through resampling techniques like Random UnderSampling and SMOTE, and preparing the data for model training. Four distinct machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Classifier, and Decision Tree Classifier, are trained. Model performance is rigorously evaluated using critical metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Furthermore, the project provides visual insights into model performance via confusion matrices.

### Part 2 - Neural Network Model:

In this phase, a neural network model is developed using Keras, a powerful deep learning framework. The neural network model is trained on the resampled dataset to improve the overall detection accuracy. Performance evaluation of the neural network includes comprehensive assessments with various evaluation metrics and the generation of confusion matrices for a detailed understanding of the model's predictive power.</p>
